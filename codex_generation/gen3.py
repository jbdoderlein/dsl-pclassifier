# Create a classifier named Alligator using RandomForest
# The features are "gender","size" and the target is lake
# Train the classifier named Alligator using the csv file alligator.csv
# The train-test split must be "accuracy","f1","recall"
# Print the accuracy score of the classifier
# Print the f1 score of the classifier
# Print the recall score of the classifier
# Print the confusion matrix of the classifier
# Create a json file named alligator.json with the following content:
# {
#   "accuracy": 0.9,
#   "f1": 0.8,
#   "recall": 0.7,
#   "confusion_matrix": [["TN", "FP"], ["FN", "TP"]]
